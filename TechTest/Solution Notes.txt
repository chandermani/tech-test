- The solution has been developed using ATDD (https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/atdd/) with a focus on acceptance tests
- Acceptance tests were built and verified before refactoring was done.
- The solution does not replace the existing static classes and works within constraints.
- The new feature is implemented using the Query paradigm from the command query pattern.

Area of improvements
- Failing scenarios and failures need to be handled better. Some validations like the customer not present in not handled.
- We do not use DI framework instead we handcraft the dependencies.
- The DB model and domain model should be separated to allow us to flexibility to evolve both types of models.
- As the solution evolved and more complexity is added, we need to add more unit test as acceptance test will not suffice.
